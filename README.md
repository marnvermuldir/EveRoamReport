# Roam Report

A tool for generating reports for a fleet roam.

Forked from [ThatCasualMatt / EveRoamReport](https://github.com/ThatCasualMatt/EveRoamReport)

# Usage

Currently hosted here: https://everoamreport.minin.io/

THIS TOOL WORKS BEST IN EDGE OR FIREFOX. YOU MUST CLICK PROCESS FLEET LOG SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE A FINAL REPORT IS GENERATED!

Input: A fleet chat log.

The tool then generates a list of kills that those pilots participated in. You can then manually deselect kills you're not interested in.

Finally, generate an after action report template to be used in a phpBB forum.

Designed to be used within EVE University forums. Very much WIP.
